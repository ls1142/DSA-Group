Look algorithm:
instructions for input file:
First of the 2 numbers at the top is number of floors. Second is capacity
There must be a floor input for each floor
If no person gets on at a floor there must still be a floor input with no space after the colon eg. "4:"
Scan algorithm:
instructions for input file:
First of the 2 numbers at the top is number of floors. Second is capacity
There must be a floor input at each floor initially stated
Additional floor inputs will increase number of floors
MYLIFT algorithm:
instructions for input file:
First of the 2 numbers at the top is number of floors. Second is capacity
Additional floor inputs will increase number of floors
